<p>My teenage daughter has a similar sense of humor to myself, and one of the christmas presents I got her were three funny t-shirts. After looking at a number of humorous t-shirts sites, I found myself at Snorg Tees with three t-shirts in my shopping cart.</p>
<p>When I see my daughter, it makes e happy to see her wearing one of the shirts I bought her, and while she was working on a school project, with her local paper, and it made me smile to see her wearing one the shirts stating I &gt; U. -- in the local paper! ;-)</p>
<p>These shirts were great, and I would totally go back to buy more t-shirts, except for one thing--the sexually exploitative ads that now follow me around the Internet. Since Snorg Tees has my profile as middle aged man, successfully placed a cookie on my computer, I get the extra special advertisements, like the ones you see below.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe this is an appropriate profiling for some middle aged men, but not me. I have a teenage daughter, and it fuck&rsquo;n hurts to have to look at sexy looking pictures of other girls the same age. Fuck you Snorg Tees for this practice.</p>
<p>If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed I&rsquo;m working to strengthen and empower my daughters perspective of herself in this world, and I will not support your company, and your sexually exploitative advertising perspective. Thanks for contributing to the world being a shittier place Snorg Tees, you won't get my business anymore.</p>
