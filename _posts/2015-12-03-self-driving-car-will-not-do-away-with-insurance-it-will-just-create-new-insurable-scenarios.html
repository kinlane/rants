<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/">I read a fairly regular stream of news that self-driving cars will disrupt this, and disrupt that, with the insurance industry being top of this list</a>. While I'm sure th self-driving car will shift the landscape for insurance, it will not do away the need for insurance, like some folks like to chant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm think there are two major influences that will keep the insurance industry doing very well:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Insurance Companies Are Powerful </strong>- They have a bunch of money, lobbying power, and are very creative when it comes to structuring insurance in their favor.</li>
<li><strong>Humans Are Such A Special Creature -</strong> Humans excel at doing very stupid things in our vehicles, and I'm sure the illusion of saftety with the car driving for you, will only create new situations.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, I'm skeptical of any claim by someone selling technology, let alone the wide sweeping disruption claims that technologists, and venture capitalists love to claim.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the impact that self-driving cars will on the insurance industry, there will be plenty of creativity and stupidity to keep the insurance alive and doing well. It makes for a good attention grabbing headline though!</p>
